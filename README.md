Please have the editor screen size as 1400 by 500 for the full experience.

# Synopsis
Monsters have been bullied and hunted all throughout history - and they've had enough!

The tribes have joined forces and have elected you to lead them in their fight against the evil human empire.

Take charge of a diverse army and use their unique abilities to overwhelm the human defences and avenge our monster ancestors.

# How To Play

Once you have selected a level (Friendly Flowers is recommended for beginners) you will start with 100 gold.

Your goal is take away all of the enemies lives before the timer runs out.

To do this you will have to spawn monsters, either by clicking on their icon, or pressing their hotkey.

You will get more money to spawn stronger monsters as your current monsters advance.

Be careful! The humans will be building towers to stop you!

# Monster Details

Skelli - The only monster that you can afford at the start, makes good money for the price and is decent cannon fodder.

Gobbo - The main money maker. Moves really fast and will be the backbone of your economy, will die in two shots, however.

Hydros - Ultimate damage dealer. Costs a lot and doesn't have great health but will do immense damage to the enemy settlement.

Shronk - Tank. Expensive and can't do damage but has an abudance of health and towers will target him first.

Summoner - Spawns Skellis and will move slowly to stay out of trouble. Can be useful to overwhelm the enemy.

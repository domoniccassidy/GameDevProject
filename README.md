# Please have the editor screen size as 1400 by 500 for the full experience.

# Synopsis

# Monsters have been bullied and hunted all throughout history - and they've had enough!

# The tribes have joined forces and have elected you to lead them in their fight against the evil human empire.

# Take charge of a diverse army and use their unique abilities to overwhelm the human defences and avenge our monster ancestors.

# How To Play

# Once you have selected a level (Friendly Flowers is recommended for beginners) you will start with 100 gold.

# Your goal is take away all of the enemies lives before the timer runs out.

# To do this you will have to spawn monsters, either by clicking on their icon, or pressing their hotkey.

# You will get more money to spawn stronger monsters as your current monsters advance.

# Be careful! The humans will be building towers to stop you!

# Monster Details

# Skelli - The only monster that you can afford at the start, makes good money for the price and is decent cannon fodder.

# Gobbo - The main money maker. Moves really fast and will be the backbone of your economy, will die in two shots, however.

# Hydros - Ultimate damage dealer. Costs a lot and doesn't have great health but will do immense damage to the enemy settlement.

# Shronk - Tank. Expensive and can't do damage but has an abudance of health and towers will target him first.

# Summoner - Spawns Skellis and will move slowly to stay out of trouble. Can be useful to overwhelm the enemy.
